# Reflection 
> During inbound calls, customerâ€™s dial reaches the Call Management Centre (CMC) or the Interactive Voice Response Unit of the Travel Company for any of their in-phone inquiries. It is assumed that a series of questions must be asked by the call centre officers to gather the substantial information before they are re-directed to a Relationship Manager. Necessary information required are personal information, reason of their call, and travel information. Payment information are only to be asked when customers are wishing to purchase a travel package. In regards what was mentioned in earlier assumptions, fraudulence should be considered hence security protocols must be implemented to ensure data integrity shared.
