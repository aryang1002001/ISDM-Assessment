# Reflection 
# Transaction Fraud
> Arguably one of the most important assumptions that can be made is in regards to transaction fraud. This is an extremely important issue that affects many businesses and needs to be adressed. In relation to the system, there is potential for transaction fraud to be commited through in - phone purchases. In order to eliminate this issue, meticulous security protocols have to be implemented during the development of the system. Additionally, these protocols will have to be reviewed consistently in order to determine any gaps or faults in the protocols, ensuring that the threat of transaction fraud is non - existant.

# Gathering Information
> During inbound calls, customerâ€™s dial reaches the Call Management Centre (CMC) or the Interactive Voice Response Unit of the Travel Company for any of their in-phone inquiries. It is assumed that a series of questions must be asked by the call centre officers to gather the substantial information before they are re-directed to a Relationship Manager. Necessary information required are personal information, reason of their call, and travel information. Payment information are only to be asked when customers are wishing to purchase a travel package. In regards what was mentioned in earlier assumptions, fraudulence should be considered hence security protocols must be implemented to ensure data integrity shared.
