# Reflection 
# Assumption on Transaction Confirmation
After completion of a transaction, it is assumed a receipt and confirmation of the transaction is sent to each customer. This confirmation received by the customer would include key information such as their customer details, their unique reference ID, travel booking details and confirmation of the holiday package purchased. This not only provides proof of purchase to the patron, but also provides some security when it comes to dealing with any potential concerns which may arise at a later date.

# Assumption on Accepting Calls 
It is assumed that calls made by potential customers will be accepted, answered and connected to a relationship manager. This assumption stands during periods where there may be an influx in caller traffic. In these scenarios where lines are too congested and customers may be redirected to an Automatic Call Distributer, they are still expected to eventually connect to a relationship manager when permitted.
