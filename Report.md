## Executive Summary
A major travel company is pushing innovative efforts to improve their in-house Call Management Centre (CMC) and is seeking professional assistance in developing a new information system. This report aims to identify, analyse and evaluate the existing CMC, in order to improve the current system and align key stakeholder requirements. The report will identify key stakeholders and address their issues in relation to call flow control, provision of service to end customers, integration of a profiler tool and matching users based on profiles. Through the use stages 1 and 2 of the design thinking process, the report will design and formulate ideas based on the existing system. Additionally, key assumptions are identified and various models are produced to provide an in depth analysis on the scope, functions and processes of both the current and proposed system.

#### 3.2 Define
A major travel company is pushing innovative efforts to improve their in-house Call Management Centre (CMC) and is seeking professional assistance in developing a new information system. Within the company are Relationship Managers, who&#39;s role is to satisfy current and potential customers with travel needs. Business managers of the company strategize that an upgrade of their in-phone sales activities (inbound/outbound call rating and call flow rate) is a huge asset to RM&#39;s sales motives and offer customers the best in-phone service experience with the company. Considering the vast amount of travel packages offered by the company, the new information system will improve call flow rate by allowing a more effective alignment of customers with specific needs and Relationship Managers with the appropriate portfolio to deliver customer satisfaction.

As a way of matching the right customer to the right Relationship Manager, the system embodies a &#39;Profiler Tool&#39; in which sets a profile for both users of the systems. Attributes within these profiles feed the decision-making system in allocation of Relationship Manager and Customers. From this, business managers hope to expect a better customer experience which leads to growth in customer relationship and profitable gains.

To add upon the profiler feature of the system, it is worth mentioning that Relationship Managers are also evaluated and scaled based on the effectiveness and efficiency of their sales performance. Conversely, customers are also scored from 1-10 based upon their transaction history and call frequency with the travel company.

When Relationship Managers make outbound calls as a means to promote products and attract potential buyers. The system offers relationship managers a &#39;target list&#39; of customers that suspects commonalities of attributes between RM and the customer. When making these outbound calls, the system prepares Relationship Managers with reference to customer profile and an outlined script of their sales activity.

For customers wishing to inquire and purchase travel packages through inbound calls, their dials are redirected to the Call Management Centre that prioritise their calls. As a means to maximise call handling effectiveness, customers with the highest score are prioritised and directed to their appropriate RM manager. Furthermore, inbound traffic calls can occur leading uncertain wait time for customers. To compensate this, the system manages these in-dial waiting customers to an Interactive Voice Response unit to gather information of their needs which then redirects them to an Automatic Call Distributor to segment callers to their appropriate Relationship Manager when ready.

Point of View Statements

As a customer, the current system:

- Can take too long to connect to someone to talk about holiday packages especially when its busy, making it a tedious process
- Calling the company is time consuming and is dependent on the reliability of staff and phone lines
- May not be providing me with the package which best suits my wants

As a Relationship Manager, the current system:

- Doesn&#39;t provide me with enough information to best suit each unique individual and tailor their preferences
- Lacks the ability to match me with potential customers where my skills are of use when it comes to securing deals

As the owner, the current system:

- Lacks efficiency when it comes to connecting customers and relationship managers
