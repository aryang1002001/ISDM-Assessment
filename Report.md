## Executive Summary
A major travel company is pushing innovative efforts to improve their in-house Call Management Centre (CMC) and is seeking professional assistance in developing a new information system. This report aims to identify, analyse and evaluate the existing CMC, in order to improve the current system and align key stakeholder requirements. The report will identify key stakeholders and address their issues in relation to call flow control, provision of service to end customers, integration of a profiler tool and matching users based on profiles. Through the use stages 1 and 2 of the design thinking process, the report will design and formulate ideas based on the existing system. Additionally, key assumptions are identified and various models are produced to provide an in depth analysis on the scope, functions and processes of both the current and proposed system.

#### 3.2 Define
A major travel company is pushing innovative efforts to improve their in-house Call Management Centre (CMC) and is seeking professional assistance in developing a new information system. Within the company are Relationship Managers, who&#39;s role is to satisfy current and potential customers with travel needs. Business managers of the company strategize that an upgrade of their in-phone sales activities (inbound/outbound call rating and call flow rate) is a huge asset to RM&#39;s sales motives and offer customers the best in-phone service experience with the company. Considering the vast amount of travel packages offered by the company, the new information system will improve call flow rate by allowing a more effective alignment of customers with specific needs and Relationship Managers with the appropriate portfolio to deliver customer satisfaction.

As a way of matching the right customer to the right Relationship Manager, the system embodies a &#39;Profiler Tool&#39; in which sets a profile for both users of the systems. Attributes within these profiles feed the decision-making system in allocation of Relationship Manager and Customers. From this, business managers hope to expect a better customer experience which leads to growth in customer relationship and profitable gains.

To add upon the profiler feature of the system, it is worth mentioning that Relationship Managers are also evaluated and scaled based on the effectiveness and efficiency of their sales performance. Conversely, customers are also scored from 1-10 based upon their transaction history and call frequency with the travel company.

When Relationship Managers make outbound calls as a means to promote products and attract potential buyers. The system offers relationship managers a &#39;target list&#39; of customers that suspects commonalities of attributes between RM and the customer. When making these outbound calls, the system prepares Relationship Managers with reference to customer profile and an outlined script of their sales activity.

For customers wishing to inquire and purchase travel packages through inbound calls, their dials are redirected to the Call Management Centre that prioritise their calls. As a means to maximise call handling effectiveness, customers with the highest score are prioritised and directed to their appropriate RM manager. Furthermore, inbound traffic calls can occur leading uncertain wait time for customers. To compensate this, the system manages these in-dial waiting customers to an Interactive Voice Response unit to gather information of their needs which then redirects them to an Automatic Call Distributor to segment callers to their appropriate Relationship Manager when ready.

Point of View Statements

As a customer, the current system:

- Can take too long to connect to someone to talk about holiday packages especially when its busy, making it a tedious process
- Calling the company is time consuming and is dependent on the reliability of staff and phone lines
- May not be providing me with the package which best suits my wants

As a Relationship Manager, the current system:

- Doesn&#39;t provide me with enough information to best suit each unique individual and tailor their preferences
- Lacks the ability to match me with potential customers where my skills are of use when it comes to securing deals

As the owner, the current system:

- Lacks efficiency when it comes to connecting customers and relationship managers

#### 3.3 Ideate
How Might We Statements

- How might we retain and upgrade customer loyalty
- How might we better handle fraudulence of customer information and transaction
- How might we protect the data of consumers
- How might we find a way to upsell consumers
- How might we innovate the profiler tool of the system
- How might we upskill selling interactions of RM

# 9. Evaluation of Scrum -

With the implementation of the agile methodology scrum, we were able to iteratively develop parts of the new system and incrementally satisfy the target objectives. As scrum is characterised by its emphasis on teamwork, we were required to be cross-functional, accountable and self-organised. The inclusion of all users and consideration of clients in our development process allowed us to efficiently manage expectations of the travel companies key stakeholders.

Through the preparation of a product backlog, user stories were prioritised based on its importance to the outlined goals of the new system. The application of four main sprints over the course of 8 weeks allowed the gradual completion of objectives and provided time to ensure they aligned with the travel companies requirements. The highest prioritised tasks outlined in the product backlog became the functional targets for each sprint. The sprints were complemented with routine meetings, reviews and sprint planning phases so that each individual had an understanding of all outlined tasks.

As transparency is a key characteristic in scrum development, we ensured all stakeholders were informed on the current progress of the project. As such continuous feedback from different perspectives on the system were taken into consideration and acted upon throughout each sprint. This allowed not only our team to collaboratively identify any problems, but to also ensure our development was still aligned with the end goals with each iteration.

Overall, the effectiveness of the scrum approach is observed especially in projects where there are high levels of user interaction, as seen within the travel companies situation. The flexibility and contemporary nature allowed for new developments for the system to be adjusted as they were identified. Scrum, complemented with the use of design thinking should allow the project to transition from concept to implementation smoothly.

# 10. System Evaluation

# 10.1 Benefits

The developed information system to improve the in-house call management centre can reap both tangible and intangible benefits for the travel company&#39;s stakeholders

- With the provision of Caller ID, it would be easier for both relationship managers and customers to reference back to older calls if they wish to. Having a generated Caller ID also eases the processes to analyse consumer and relationship data during the profiler score process.
- Better alignment of relationship managers and customers based on matched details and attributes.
- The new system recognises customer wait time and prompts an interactive response unit to manage these waiting customers.
- Improve call routing and dynamic call flow control for inbound and outbound calls
- Provide more assistance to relationship managers in their ability to provide an improved service to end customers
- Integrate a profiler tool to set and track profiles of users within the system

# 10.2 Possible Failures

When developing a new system, potential failures are to be expected hence precautions,  maintenance, and repairs are necessary throughout the System Development Life Cycle. Below are potential system failures that could occur.

- When implementing the system, it is expected that resistance to change is prevalent for some travel company staff.
- Requires consistent telephone connection, hence can experience operational delays when associated third party phone distributors are having technical complications.
- Data entry issues can be made as collections of info are done through the phone. With this being said, customers may experience trouble upon arrival at the airline check-in gate. Inconsistency in data entry could result in duplicates of customer information.
- The on-phone travel booking process may not be targeted for many consumers as younger generation of consumers would prefer booking tickets online where data entry and transaction details are ensured
- Transaction fraud is always a potential failure when transactions are made over the phone as a customer&#39;s call could potentially be intercepted or monitored
